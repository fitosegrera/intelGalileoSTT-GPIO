intelGalileoSTT-GPIO
====================

Python libraries and example code for voice recognition to control GPIO pins of the Intel Galileo board.
Works with RaspberryPi but some adjustments must be made.



Note: this code was originally designed in colaboration with the Union-Galileo group at the China-U.S maker competition 2014 in Beijing China. It was developed for a open source Smart Home model that operates using the Galileo board as the main brain.

For an example please see the file smartHome.py insede the folder "/code" from the repository.
